        EXERCISE #2
        Now that you’ve built a simple webpage, let’s add some CSS!
        Follow the steps below:
        
        1. Create a new file called `styles.css` in the same folder as this HTML file.
        2. Open `styles.css` and add styles for the following:
           - Style the `<body>` to have a background color of light blue.
           - Style the `<ul>` list to center it on the page and add some padding.
           - Change the `<li>` color to a dark shade of blue and increase the font size.
        
        When done, test your styles by opening this file in your browser!
